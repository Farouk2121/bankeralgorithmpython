This is a banker's algorithm code that takes number of resources and number of processes as input (using gui)
,then it takes the available resouces as an input,then it generates a matrix with the designated size and let's the user enter for each process the amount of resources 
for allocation matrix and maximum matrix.
After that it let's the user determine if one of the processes requests an ammount of resources of a specific type.
Note:
processes and resources start at 0
After that the output is the safe sequence of the processes and the available resources matrix after excuting each process.
The code is dynamic for any number of resources/processes
Enjoy!
